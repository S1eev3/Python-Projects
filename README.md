# Python-Projects

This repository is for my projects during the Python course with The Tech Academy. 

## Projects:

* Phonebook
* Check Files GUI
* Checkbook
* File Transfer

### Phonebook

This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves contact's name, phone number, and email address in a databse and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries. 

### Check Files GUI

This project allows the user to choose to transfer all .txt files from one chose directory to another. All files that are moved will be saved in a database. 

### Checkbook

This project acts as a check register for users to create multiple profiles to input deposits, withdrawals, track all activity and view current balance. 

### File Transfer

This project serves as a quick and simple file transfer app which includes a GUI that allows a user to select source and destination folders to transfer all files that have been created or modified within a set timeframe.
